Loops in Ruby:
==============

Loops are programming constructs that help you repeat an action an arbitrary 
number of times.

The methods Array#each, Array#select etc. are the most frequently used loops 
since the primary use of loops is to iterate over or transform a collection,
something that we'll learn in the chapter on "Arrays in Ruby."

Infinite Loops:
---------------

Infinite loops keep running till you explicitly ask them to stop.
They are syntactically the simplest to write. Here goes one:

loop do 
    puts "this line will be executed for an infinite amount of time" 
end

Run a block of code N times:
----------------------------

Say N is 5, let us imagine how it might look.

5.times do
    # do the stuff that needs to be done
  end
