Beginner's Guide to Expressions in Ruby:
========================================

Ruby uses the == operator for comparing two objects.

The other usual operators like greater than (>), less than (<), greater
than or equal to (>=) etc. are supported. 

Boolean expressions like the above always return either the true or false objects.

Combining Expressions using the && and || operators:
----------------------------------------------------

You can use the keywords || (read as 'or'), && (read as 'and') to combine expressions.

Negating expressions

Ruby lets you negate expressions using the ! operator (read as 'not'). 
For instance, ! (name == 'Jill') will return false if the name is Jill and true for 
any other name.
