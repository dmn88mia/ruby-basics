Hashes in Ruby:
===============

Introduction to Ruby Hashes:
----------------------------

Creating a Hash:
----------------

A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. You retrieve or create a new
entry in a Hash by referring to its key. Hashes are also called 'associative arrays',
'dictionary', 'HashMap' etc. in other languages

A blank hash can be declared using two curly braces {}. Here is an example of a Hash in Ruby:

student_ages = {
    "Jack" => 10,
    "Jill" => 12,
    "Bob" => 14
  }

The names (Jack, Jill, Bob) are the 'keys', and 10, 12 and 14 are the corresponding values.
Now try creating a simple hash with the following keys and values:

Ramen = 3
Dal Makhani = 4
Tea = 2
 
restaurant_menu = {
  "Ramen" => 3,
  "Dal Makhani" => 4,
  "Tea" => 2
}

Fetch values from a Hash:
-------------------------

You can retrieve values from a Hash object using [] operator. The key of the required value
should be enclosed within these square brackets.

Now try finding the price of a Ramen from the restaurant_menu hash: write the name of the object,
follow it with a square bracket, and place the key inside the brackets. In this case the key is a
string so enclose the key in quotes.

 
restaurant_menu["Ramen"]

Modifying a Hash:
-----------------

Once you've created a Hash object, you would want to add new key-value pairs as well as modify 
existing values.

Here is how you would set the price of a "Ramen" in the restaurant_menu hash:

restaurant_menu["Ramen"] = 3
In fact, you can create a blank hash and add all the values later. Now why don't you try assigning
the following values to an empty hash?

Dal Makhani: 4.5
Tea: 2
 
restaurant_menu = {}
restaurant_menu["Dal Makhani"] = 4.5
restaurant_menu["Tea"] = 2

Iterating over a Hash:
----------------------

You can use the each method to iterate over all the elements in a Hash. 
However unlike Array#each, when you iterate over a Hash using each, it passes two
values to the block: the key and the value of each element.

Let us see how we can use the each method to display the restaurant menu.

Example Code:

restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.each do | item, price |
  puts "#{item}: $#{price}"
end
 

The restaurant is doing well, but it is forced to raise prices due to increasing costs.
Use the each method to increase the price of all the items in the restaurant_menu by 10%.

Remember: in the previous example we only displayed the keys and values of each item in the hash.
But in this exercise, you have to modify the hash and increase the value of each item.

 
restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.each do |item, price|
  restaurant_menu[item] = price + (price * 0.1)	`
end


Extracting the keys and values from a Hash:
-------------------------------------------

Every Hash object has two methods: keys and values. The keys method returns an array of all 
the keys in the Hash. Similarly values returns an array of just the values.

Try getting an array of all the keys in the restaurant_menu hash:
 
restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.keys

STDOUT:

["Ramen", "Dal Makhani", "Coffee"]
